# NAYA Hash

Goal of this POW algorithm is to achieve FPGA and ASIC resistance while keeping CPU / GPU competitive.

Please note that with today technologies, it is almost unfeasible to be fully FPGA / ASIC resistance.
An algorithm claimed ASIC/FPGA resistant today can be broken tomorrow. This is a cat-mouse game where we're playing with the factor of time.
